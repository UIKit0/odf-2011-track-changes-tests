The simple1 and simple2 tests both have ranged annotations these are
natively supported by abiword and its abw format, and should use
annotation-end to mark the range in ODF.

LibreOfficeAnnotation.odt is a point annotation made with LibreOffice
from Fedora 16 (libreoffice-core-3.4.3.2-15.fc16.x86_64).

The annotation-with-title.abw is very similar to simple1 but the test
checks the RDF from the ODT file to see that the "title" attribute
from the abw is preserved.
