is-using-m_vecInlineFmt-ok.abw

 This is checking if hijacking the m_vecInlineFmt variable in 
 ODi_TextContent_ListenerState::startElement() et al is ok. It seems to be fine
 because if a revision ends after an XML element we are going to get delta: elements
 showing the bold/italic changes anyway, so it doesn't matter that the formatting
 stack is reused here, we can pick up the closing of formatting via change records.
 Though the law of uncertainty would make it simpler to have a separate stack for revision stuff.
